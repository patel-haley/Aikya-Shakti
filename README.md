# Aikya's Shakti

Aikya is a designed space settlement that orbits Ganymede, made to hold human civailization. When designing Aikya, one major concern was posed: How will humans adjust to life there? This brought me to develop Shakti. 

"Shakti" meaning power in Sanskrit, is a mental health chatbot made for Aikya's residents to seek emotional support and guidance. Shakti is prompted by Aikyans and returns a crafted response based on the user's needs. A simple user-interface is built for high-functionality.
